# concats

Web app built to help Dr. No by:

1. taking a csv file

2. for every row, create a new csv file comprised of a single column containing the same number of rows as the OG csv file, where the value of this new single column is a string concatenation of multiple field values from that row in the OG csv file.

3. Render the output (initially as plain text to copy from a browser (via the initial web app), and eventually as its own csv file (via the coming electron app)).
